# AC Robotics Sensor Board

## Description
This project is the schematics and routing for a sensorboard for AC Robotic's XP1 Canis project.
This board controls 7 ultrasonic sensors, 3 LEDs, and 1 IMU. On board there is an ESP32 to collect and transform all the incoming signals.

### What It Does
This board connects all the components needed for this board in a simple 2-layer design. The onboard ESP is meant to process and output all the signals to XP1's motherboard.

### Technologies Used
The main technology used was Altium designer to make the PCB, as well as data sheets of each component.

## Installation
This project can be downloaded and opened like any other Altium project.

## Usage
This sensor board does not have to be used in XP1 Canis and can be integrated into any project needed.
As well, the concepts can be translated into more complex sensor boards easily by expanding the input components.
